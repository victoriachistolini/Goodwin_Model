# Goodwin Model Experiments

# Source Code Organization

- All top level files have the _main.m name scheme. 

- To start out the main.m shows the basic functionalities of the model implementation of the Goodwin Model [2] 
such as a single oscillating cell and successful synchronization of the model run with 10 cells.

- fig1a_main.m shows code for the replication of figure 1a from [1] with the Goodwin 
3-state model using mean field coupling and a library of predefined parameter sets.
